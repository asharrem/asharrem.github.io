      <h2>Cascading Windows on Openbox WM</h2>
      <p><a href="http://openbox.org/">Openbox</a>&nbsp;is a stacking Window Manager. Tiling is
        generally achevied by Keybindings.&nbsp;<a href="./code_snippets/cascade_rc.xml"
          rel="nofollow">cascade_rc.xml</a>&nbsp;is a keybind I wrote that cascades openbox client windows (per
        monitor).
        For a number of years I've been searching how I might "Cascade" windows, with most every reference saying it
        can't
        be done with openbox alone, and to use a "Tiling" application. Well...using the built-in looping
        action/condition
        we
        can
        achieve a "cascade per monitor" keybind.</p>
      <p>The basic nested loop structure is;</p>
      <div>
        <pre><code>
          ForEach
            Move Window to Top Left
            Lower
            ForEach
              Nudge All other Windows
            End ForEach
          End ForEach
              </code></pre>
      </div>
      <figure><img src="./images/cascading.png" alt="cascading openbox windows">

      </figure>
      <p>With a few other "actions" we are able to maintain "Focus" or include "minimized/iconified" client
        windows. Un-iconifying or maximizing minimized windows requires the iconified windows get "Focus", so currently
        I am unable to maintain focus of the original window in this instance.
