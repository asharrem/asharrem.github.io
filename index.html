      <summary>Cascading Windows on Openbox WM</summary>
      <article>
        <p><a href="http://openbox.org/">Openbox</a>&nbsp;is a [floating/stacking] Window Manager. For a number of years
          I've been searching how I might "Cascade" windows, with most every reference saying it can't be done with
          openbox alone, and to use a "Tiling" application. Tiling is generally achevied by Keybindings.&nbsp;<a
            href="./code_snippets/cascade_rc.xml" rel="nofollow">Cascade_rc.xml</a>&nbsp;is a keybind
          I wrote that cascades openbox client windows (per monitor). Using the built-in looping action/condition we can
          achieve a "cascade per monitor" keybind.</p>
        <p>The basic nested loop structure is;</p>
        <div>
          <pre><code>
                ForEach
                  Move Window to Top Left
                  Lower
                  ForEach
                    Nudge All other Windows
                  End ForEach
                End ForEach
                    </code></pre>
        </div>
        <figure><img src="./images/cascading.png" alt="cascading openbox windows">
          <figcaption>Cascading Windows via Openbox Keybinds</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>With a few other "actions" we are able to maintain "Focus" or include "minimized/iconified" client windows.
          Un-iconifying or maximizing minimized windows requires the iconified windows get "Focus", so currently I am
          unable to maintain focus of the original window in this instance.

      <summary>Classless CSS</summary>
      <article>
        Starting a new HTML project usually involves deciding what CSS framework to run with. Learning a CSS framework
        was something I didn't want to do. Fortunately I stumbled accross "Classless" CSS, which made my semantic HTML
        look much better!
