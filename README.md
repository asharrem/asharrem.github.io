  Lightweight Ubuntu Distribution specifically built to run [NxWitness (by Networkoptix)](https://www.networkoptix.com/nx-witness/) as a Server & Client Appliance.

This public github hosts various files & scripts specific to NxOS, as well as some code that aids various projects I work on.
My personal favourite is [cascade_rc.xml](https://asharrem.github.io/cascade_rc.xml).
## Cascading Windows on Openbox WM
[Openbox](http://openbox.org/) is a stacking & tiling Window Manager. Tiling is generally achevied by Keybindings.
  [cascade_rc.xml](https://asharrem.github.io/cascade_rc.xml) is a keybind I wrote that cascades openbox client windows (per monitor).
