    <h2 dir="auto">Cascading Windows on Openbox WM</h2>
    <p dir="auto"><a href="http://openbox.org/" rel="nofollow">Openbox</a>&nbsp;is a stacking &amp; tiling Window Manager. Tiling is generally achevied by Keybindings.&nbsp;<a href="https://asharrem.github.io/cascade_rc.xml" rel="nofollow">cascade_rc.xml</a>&nbsp;is a keybind I wrote that cascades openbox client windows (per monitor). For a number of years I've been searching how I might "Cascade" windows, with most every reference saying it can't be done with openbox alone, and to use a "Tiling" application. Well...using a looping action/condition we can achieve a "cascade per monitor" keybind.</p>
    <p dir="auto">The nested loop structure is;</p>
    <div>
    <pre><code>
ForEach
  Move Window to Top Left
  Lower
    ForEach
      Nudge All Windows
    End ForEach
End ForEach
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p dir="auto">The result is a bit like the first action of a "Card Shuffle", and the nested loops will "Cascade" client windows.</p>
    <p dir="auto">With a few other "actions" we are able to maintain "Focus" or include "minimized/iconified" client windows. Un-iconifying or maximizing minimized windows requires the iconified windows get "Focus", so currently I am unable to maintain focus of the original window in this instance.</p>
